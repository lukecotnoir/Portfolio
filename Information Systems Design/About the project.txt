This slideshow details the semester long project which I completed with a team of 3 others.
This project was for the Information Systems Analysis and Design class in which I recieved a perfect score for the project and recieved an A in the class.

The project required us to work in a group of 4 to perform ongoing systems analysis and design tasks in order to begin creating a system in which students of the Physics,
Computer Science, and Engineering (PCSE) department could better find and communicate with alumni.

The first big task in this project was requirement gathering. We needed to find out exactly what this system needed to do and how best to go about it.
To do this, we interviewed major internal stakeholders Clair Dorsey (Outreach Coordinator) and Dr. Riedl (Department Chair). We also created a questionnaire for operational stakeholders.

We then created a list of use cases for the system and narrowed those down into 3 subsystems. The accounts, communities, and messaging subsystem.
    Accounts: Deals with the users accounts
    Communities: Communities which students and alumni can join to post about topics or questions relating to that community (i.e. physics community, software engineering, etc)
    Messaging: Deals with direct messages between students and alumni
From this we developed more detailed use cases. 

After this, we moved to performing design tasks such as an ERD representing the rough outline of the database, UI storyboarding, a structure chart of the system, and finally basic pseudocode.

This project gave me great experience in working and communicating with a team and gave knowledge and hands-on experience in information systems design taks and systems engineering.
