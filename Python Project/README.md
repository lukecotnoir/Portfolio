# Lab 11 - Shell for GUI

For this (and following labs), you may either:
* Work independently
* Have a Brainstorm Buddy
  * work with a partner of your choice!
  * Buddies can help each other debug their code, however files may not be shared and each partner will submit their code for grading independently.
* Pair Programming - driver-navigator pair programming
  * You actively collaborate on all code development (no independent work)
  * Follow guidelines from previous pair programming labs


# Lab Directions
For this lab, you and your partner are given overall requirements and some tests,
but you must come up with some of the intermediate steps yourself.

You TA will provide a presentation with general directions.

The provided code is used to generate some data files, and demonstrate showing a
MatPlotLib plot on a tkInter GUI.

The data files here are written in Big Endian form.

The script in `given/demo_fft.py` and `given/fft.py` provide a partial solution to Lab 10.
You may build off this code, but DO NOT modify the given code.
